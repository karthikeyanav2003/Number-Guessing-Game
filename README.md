ABSTRACT:
The Number Guessing Game is an engaging project that combines the thrill of random number generation with an interactive graphical user interface. The objective of the game is for the player to correctly guess the randomly assigned number within a limited number of attempts. Developed using Python and the Tkinter library, this project offers an entertaining and educational experience.

The game begins with the computer generating a random number, which remains hidden from the player. The player interacts with a Tkinter-based GUI that includes an input field to enter their guess and a button to submit the guess. Upon each guess, the player receives clues such as "Too high" or "Too low" to guide them toward the correct answer.
